<p>Your four-legged friends may detest water, but that is no excuse to keep them away from the bath. You need to make the bathing routine at least a weekly affair. That will keep their coat and bodies free from ticks and worms residing inside. Also, their nails should be kept small to prevent them from scratching any surface too wildly and harming themselves in doing so.</p>

<li>
<h4><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Keep its kennel clean.</strong></span></h4>
